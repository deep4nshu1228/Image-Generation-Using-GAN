# Image-Generation-Using-GAN
The goal of the project "Image Generation using GAN" is to develop a system that can generate realistic and visually appealing images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are a type of deep learning model that consists of two components: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network generates synthetic images, while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between the real and generated images.

The primary objective of the project is to train the GAN model on a large dataset of real images and generate new images that are indistinguishable from the real ones. The project aims to explore the capabilities of GANs in capturing the underlying data distribution and generating high-quality images with rich visual details.

By successfully achieving this goal, the project aims to contribute to the field of computer vision and image processing by demonstrating the potential of GANs for image synthesis tasks. The generated images can have various applications, such as in the fields of art, entertainment, virtual reality, and data augmentation for training other machine learning models.

Overall, the project seeks to push the boundaries of image generation techniques and showcase the power of GANs in creating realistic and visually appealing images.
